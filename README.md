GCC or G++ compiler
SDL2 library
MinGW (for Windows)

## Features of the Queue Simulator

1. Queue-Based Traffic Management

   Uses the Queue data structure (FIFO) to simulate real-world traffic flow where vehicles are processed in the order they arrive.

2. Vehicle Insertion and Removal
   
   Vehicles are added to the lane using enqueue() and removed using dequeue() when they pass the intersection.

3. Multiple Lane Support
   
   Supports independent queues for different traffic lanes, allowing simultaneous processing of multiple traffic streams.

4. Traffic Processing Algorithm
   
   Implements a loop-based algorithm that checks each lane and processes vehicles according to queue rules and traffic conditions.

5. Efficient Operations
   
   Core queue operations like insertion, deletion, and front access are performed in constant time for better performance.

6. Modular Design
   
   Separate files and classes are used for queues, vehicles, and lane logic, improving readability and maintainability.

7. Simulation Visualization Support
   
   Includes demo visuals (demo.gif) and structural diagrams to help understand program flow.

8. Testable Implementation
   
   Includes test files to validate correct behavior of queue operations.

   ##  Key Accomplishments

- **Circular Logic:** Maximized memory efficiency by reusing space in the array after vehicles exit the queue.
  
- **High Performance:** Achieved **$O(1)$** time complexity for all core traffic operations.
  
- **Congestion Control:** Implemented logic to detect and prevent data overflow during peak traffic simulations.
  
- **OOP Design:** Built a modular system in C++ that separates data management from the user interface.

## How it Works

Program Components

The simulation consists of two separate programs:

A. Generator (generator.exe):

1. Generates vehicles with random properties

2. Writes vehicle data to a file for the main program to read

3.  Spawns new vehicles every 500 milliseconds

B. Main Simulation (main.exe):

1. Reads vehicle data from the generator
   
2. Renders the intersection and vehicles
   
3. Manages traffic flow and vehicle movement
   
4. Handles traffic light cycles.


  
   
## Vehicle Types

a. Blue: Regular cars

b. Red: Ambulances

c. Dark Blue: Police cars

d. Orange-Red: Fire trucks

## Code Structure

1. main.c : Program entry point and main simulation loop
   
2. traffic_simulation.h : Header file containing structs and function declarations
   
3. traffic_simulation.c : Implementation of traffic simulation logic
   
4. generator.c : Vehicle generation logic
   




  ## Running the Simulation

1. First, start the vehicle generator:

   ```bash
   ./bin/generator.exe
   
2. In a separate terminal, start the main simulation:

   ```bash
   ./bin/main.exe

3.   Watch as vehicles spawn and navigate through the intersection
  
4. Use the close button (X) to exit the simulationControls 


## 🚦 Algorithm for Traffic Processing


The simulator follows a **Circular Queue Logic** to manage traffic flow:

1. **Vehicle Arrival (Enqueue):** - New vehicles are added to the `rear` of the queue.
   
   - Circular logic: `rear = (rear + 1) % capacity`.
     
2. **Vehicle Departure (Dequeue):** - Vehicles exit from the `front` when the traffic signal is "Green".
   
   - Circular logic: `front = (front + 1) % capacity`.
     
3. **Overflow Management:** - If `(rear + 1) % capacity == front`, the system signals a traffic jam (Queue Full).
   
4. **Underflow Management:** - If `front == -1`, the lane is empty and no processing occurs.

## Technical Documentation

For detailed technical documentation about the implementation:

1. Vehicle Generation: Vehicles are spawned at regular intervals with randomized properties.

2. Traffic Light System: Uses a timer-based system with priority adjustments based on queue lengths and emergency vehicles.

3. Collision Avoidance: Vehicles maintain safe distances and respond to traffic signals and other vehicles.

4. Queue Management: Each lane maintains its own queue, with priority handling for emergency vehicles.

5. Red Light Skipping Logic: The canVehicleSkipLight() function determines when a non-emergency vehicle can proceed through a red light based on:

      a. Wait time at the intersection

      b. Type of turn being made

      c. Presence of other vehicles
